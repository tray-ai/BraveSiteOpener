# BraveSiteOpener

**Description:**

BraveSiteOpener is a Python script designed to automate the process of opening multiple URLs using the Brave browser. By specifying the path to the Brave browser, the script registers it and sequentially opens each URL from a provided list with a slight delay between each.

**Features:**
- Registers and uses the Brave browser to open URLs.
- Opens a list of specified URLs with a customizable delay between each.
- Ideal for quickly accessing multiple web pages in the Brave browser.

**Usage:**
1. Update the `brave_path` variable in the script to the path of the Brave browser executable on your device.
2. Modify the `urls` list with your desired URLs.
3. Run the script. The Brave browser will launch and open each URL in the list with a short delay between each.
